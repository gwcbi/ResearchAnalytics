# Final Project 
## Assignment #1: Poster Presentation

Develop a poster presentation of your final research project.  You will submit your final research project as a poster (as is done for scientific conferences).  You should submit your poster in pdf format.  There are a number of websites with advise on how to put together posters, like this one from [NYU](https://guides.nyu.edu/posters). There are a variety of software within which you can make your poster.  Choose one that is comfortable for you and allows you to create the best final product.  There are a number of [templates](https://www.makesigns.com/SciPosters_Templates.aspx) available on the web, so donâ€™t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel.  There are also a number of [examples](https://www.craftofscientificposters.com/) to look through and get a feel for what these things look like.

The poster structure should be very similar to your previous research project outline, namely:

1. **Title** (feel free to make modifications from your previous assignment based on feedback and additional research)

2. **Your Name**

3. **Introduction** (including a central hypothesis to be tested/thesis statement)

4. **Methods** (including description of the data you used and/or informatics approach(es) you used as part of your research)

5. **Results** (a description of the results of your research)

6. **Discussion** (how will your results relate back to your hypothesis/thesis)

7. **Literature Cited** (including references where appropriate, especially for methods and introductory ideas, but in a poster, the references are minimal)

I prefer posters with less text and more beautiful graphics!  Results come in graphics!  Bulleted text for introduction, methods, results, is just fine.
