# ResearchAnalytics
Welcome to the course! Here on GitHub you will find all the assignments (Labs, Problelm Sets, and Final Project) for the course as well as any data and/or links to software/data to be successful in the assignments.  There are instructions for each assignment for each week.  All assignments are due on Day 7 of the week of assignment, except for the Final Project which is due on Day 3 of Week 11.  These dates are also listed on the course syllabus!  You will get the most out of the homework and the course if you work on the problem sets/labs/final project BEFORE the live session each week and bring your questions to the live session.  Good luck with the course and have fun with Research Analytics!

Sincerely,

Professor Crandall
